In a 3 month span with the San Jose Department of Transportation, I worked as a data scientist to innovate within the Vision Zero initiative, helping analysts expand their abilities to reap information from speed radar sensor data. 

There are 41 speed radar sensors spread out throughout San Jose. These sensors are active 24/7 and automatically detect any vehicle passing by, along with the respective speed (mph). 

Past efforts to understand this vast wealth of data have used pen and paper analysis, or have remained largely untouched. 

The purpose of this project was to 

1. Create a pipeline to extract the data from the sensors.
2. Create an actionable interface to empower analysts with their studies.
3. Create and present an analysis on a 3 month case study to the team to demontrate how more modernized data approaches can be used.
